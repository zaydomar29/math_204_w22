# R Markdown Intro

We can use R-markdown to typeset our work and solutions. Since we will be doing a lot of work on R, where you will need to show your code and solutions, this might be a better option since it will directly allow you to integrate your code and responses into one neat document. 

You need to know the Syntax of R-markdown, which is not too difficult to learn. You can very easily integrate some Latex functions into a markdown document (For Latex purists a better option might be to use Knitr which also allows you to integrate your code and writing together.)


# Some basics function: 

  1) \# This is used to indicate a new section
  2) \#\# This is used to indicate a new subsection
  3) \#\#\# This is used to indicate a new subsubsection
  4) Comment out text by hilighting them and clicking cmd+shft+c on MAC and cntrl+shft+c on Window
  5) Italics, by putting * on both sides of the word, example *this is an italic*
  6) Bold, by putting * on both sides, example **this is a bold font**
  7) Bold and Italic, by putting three * on both sides, example ***bold and italic***
  
## Latex Functions:
  You can bring in a whole host of Latex functions. Primarily for us the functions related to writing equations will be the most useful.
  
  i) An *in line* equation can be written by in the following manner \$ equation \$, example of an in line equation $y=mx+c$.
  ii) An equation on a separate line may be written as, \$\$ equation \$\$, example, $$y=mx+c$$.
  iii) We can also use some of the Latex fonts, such as backslash+mathbb or backslash+mathcal, example, $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathcal{L}$.

# This is a new section
## This is a new subsection
### This is a new subsubsection


Thus hashtags are used to indicate sections, if you want to use a hashtag in the document NOT signify a new section you will need to do a backslash+hastag, like this \#.

# R Code Integration:

Your $\mathtt{R}$ code can be integrated into R-markdown using what is called chunks. Chunks will always have the following format, 



```{R, chunk_name, echo = TRUE}
print("This chunk will only show the results and the code")
a = 1
b = 2
c = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)

a+b

c^2


```


Here is a hidden chunk, 

```{R, chunk_2, echo = FALSE}
print("This chunk will only show the results and not the code")
a = 1
b = 2
c = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)

a+b

c^2


```



Here is another chunk, where we used some data from Tutorial 1.

```{R, plot_funcct, echo = TRUE}
data = read.csv("/Users/zaydomar/Dropbox/Zayd/Class_Notes/MATH 204 Principles of Statistics/Tutorials/Tutorial 1/Temp_Data.csv")

plot(data$Ext,data$Force, xlab = "Extension", ylab = "Force", main = "Extension vs Force" )



```
